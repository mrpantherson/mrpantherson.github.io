## Portfolio

### Data Science and Machine Learning

Lately I’ve worked on advanced machine learning and NLP applications, including DARPA funded projects focused on detecting toxic behavior in online communities and optimizing LLM performance under constrained environments. One of the most exciting recent efforts was collaborating on a published research project where we used machine learning to estimate solar energy output from readily available data, a process traditionally requiring expensive physical sensors.

Another fun project, I built a testing setup with a front end connected to a Flask backend, backed by a SQL database with user login and role based access. It generates real time graphs from live queries and keeps data consistent through constraints and validation. The environment supports rapid feature prototyping, API testing, and database performance checks, all in a single integrated setup.

### Simulation

I spent several years working in military simulation, focusing on AV-8B Harrier training systems. Most of my work was in classified environments, but these images from an official press release show the type of trainers I worked on. The same systems were famously used by Arnold Schwarzenegger while preparing for True Lies.

### Other Projects

Over the years, I’ve explored a wide range of personal projects, everything from games and fractal generators to Boggle solvers and experimental data science tools.

I also experiment with data visualization tools like Altair and Panel to rapidly prototype interactive dashboards and visual analytics.
