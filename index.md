### Data Science

Currently teaching Python, data science, and machine learning. One of the most exciting things i've done recently is working on a team to publish work in the area of machine learning. We were able to use ML to take readily available data and calculate the energy from the sun, something that typically takes very expensive sensors to accomplish.

#### Altair

I've reacently come across the Altair API, one of its best features is its ability to easily generate HTML graphs. This is the first grammar of graphics API that i've used that I really enjoyed using so I thought I would put a few graphs up here to play with the HTML exporting.

### Simulation

I worked in military simulation for a while, most of my work was done on AV-8B trainers. As these were done in classified environments I don't have any pictures of the work, however I found these from an official press release after we had delivered this particular trainer. It was before my time, but these same trainers were used by Arnold Schwarzenegger when preparing for the movie True Lies.

### Game Boy Advance

I started my career working on Game Boy Advance, I had never worked on embedded systems before but quickly fell in love with how the system worked. Growing up in the NES/SNES era gave me an appreciation for 2D games so I am happy to have worked on one of the last systems dedicated to this type of gaming.

### Other Projects

I've enjoyed programming for a long time so I always find myself working on something: games, fractal generators, Boggle solvers, or lately data science projects.
