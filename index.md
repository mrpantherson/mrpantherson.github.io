### Data Science and Machine Learning

Lately I’ve worked on advanced machine learning and NLP applications, including DARPA funded projects focused on detecting toxic behavior in online communities and optimizing LLM performance under constrained environments. One of the most exciting recent efforts was collaborating on a published research project where we used machine learning to estimate solar energy output from readily available data, a process traditionally requiring expensive physical sensors.

Another fun project, I built a complete full stack testing environment combining a responsive front end with a secure Flask backend, a scalable SQL database, and integrated user authentication. The system supports dynamic, real time graphs generated from live database queries, making it easy to visualize trends and monitor activity. Strong database integrity is maintained through robust validation and transactional safeguards, ensuring reliable data handling. This environment serves as a versatile sandbox for developing, testing, and refining features while maintaining production level security and performance.

### Simulation

I spent several years working in military simulation, focusing on AV-8B Harrier training systems. Most of my work was in classified environments, but these images from an official press release show the type of trainers I worked on. The same systems were famously used by Arnold Schwarzenegger while preparing for True Lies.

### Other Projects

Over the years, I’ve explored a wide range of personal projects, everything from games and fractal generators to Boggle solvers and experimental data science tools.

I also experiment with data visualization tools like Altair and Panel to rapidly prototype interactive dashboards and visual analytics.
